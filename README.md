# Project Description
This project is like a piece of work that has been put together to create this idea of using owned NFTs as utility, so like somewhat interoperability is there as we can use different nft contracts' NFT Tokens (currently Ethereum based). 

In Metadating, you can easily create your profile, and you don't have to worry about storing data somewhere; everything is done in a decentralized fashion; information is on the tableland, which uses IPFS, which is decentralized. This project uses XMTP to do peer-to-peer communication once the user accepts the request.
